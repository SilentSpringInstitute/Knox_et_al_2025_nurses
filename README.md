There are 3 R files required to produce the output contained in the paper. “nta_nurses_neg.R” and “nta_nurses_pos.R” can be run in either order and are independent of each other. These two files perform identical analysis, with the former using the MS-DIAL output from ESI- mode and the latter using the MS-DIAL output from ESI+ mode as the input file. (These input data files can be found in the Supporting Information Tables S10 and S11. “nta_nurses_figures.R” generates the figures that are included in the manuscript and Supporting Information (the inputs to this file are generated by nta_nurses_neg.R and nta_nurses_pos.R”
